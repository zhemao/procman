Procman - Process Manager
===========================

Show those processes who's boss. Procman is yet another process managing program.
It has options to restart a program if it exits, restart a program if its file
is changed, and sends you notifications using libnotify.

Usage: ./procman [options] command [command args ...]

Options:
-r No Restart - do not restart when process exits
-w No Watching - do not watch for modifications
-o Output - output to the given file instead of stdout
