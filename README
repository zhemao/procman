Procman - Process Manager
===========================

Show those processes who's boss. Procman is yet another process managing 
program optimized for Linux.

It has options to restart a program if it exits, restart a program if any file
in the current directory is modified, and sends you notifications using 
libnotify.

Usage: ./procman [options] command [command args ...]

Options:
-r Restart 
	If the option argument is 1, the process will be restarted after 
	it exits. If the option argument is 0, the process will not be restarted. 
	Defaults to 1
-w Watch 
	If the option argument is 1, procman will watch for changes in the current
	directory using inotify and restart the process if any changes occur. If
	the argument is 0, the current directory is not monitored. Defaults to 1.
-o Output - output to the given file instead of stdout
